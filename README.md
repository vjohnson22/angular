# angular

I choose to create an Angular app because Angular is the most popular framework out there, with React being second. Actually, React is just a library, while Angular is a full fledged MVC framework It was created by an employee at google, and is used for single page applications. Angular has the browser build the page, as opposed to server side, which makes it load faster.

Another way it differs from React is that is has two way data binding, as opposed to one way like React 

With more practice, i may find it better than react, given that it is an entire framework

To use
```
download repository
make sure you have anugular downloaded "npm install -g @angular/cli"
launch server: ng serve -0
```
